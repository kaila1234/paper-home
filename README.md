<h1>Kaila Hamilton - All About Paper</h1>
<h2>Why did I make this website?</h2>
The reason I made my website solely about paper is because I found the topic interesting. I find how paper is used so commonly in daily life and most inidviduals know nothing about its history or even how it's made. It's suprising but fascinating at the same time.

<h2>What did I learn during this project?</h2>

During the project, I learned:

• How paper is made

•The history behind paper

•How to make borders in code

•How to make bullets in code

•How to code Javascript

<h2>Things I wish I knew in code:</h2>

How to correctly close tags, how to place code in their correct designated spots, how to code JS (javascript) and correctly do it, and lastly, how to size images.

<h2> What is my next project going to be?</h2>

I am not sure what my next project is going to be. I haven't put very much thought into it and have been very focused on this particular project. I do imagine, though that my project will most likely be on an inanimate object or thing. Or even something that is neither inanimate or an object. Maybe a project about things I like. If I do end up doing a project, it will be in Github. I do not plan on doing the project in any other app or website.
