        <h1>How It's Made</h1>

        <h2>Construction Paper</h2>
        <p>Construction paper is made from wood pulp that is processed into a thick, rough surface suitable for drawing and cutting. The pulp is dyed in various colors before being pressed and dried into sheets.</p>

        <h2>Tissue Paper</h2>
        <p>Tissue paper is made from recycled paper that is turned into pulp and then processed to remove impurities. The pulp is then bleached and sometimes dyed before being spread into thin sheets and dried. The thin sheets are then rolled into large rolls and cut into smaller sheets.</p>

        <h2>Parchment Paper</h2>
        <p>Parchment paper is made by treating paper pulp with sulfuric acid, which gelatinizes the surface of the paper and makes it non-stick and heat-resistant. The treated paper is then washed, dried, and coated with a silicone layer to enhance its non-stick properties.</p>
